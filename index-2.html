            <p>Hello, I'm Clara, I started my career in the world of communication, where I specialized in my main
                passions: art,technology and the creation of products that improve people's lives, always with a focus
                on
                sustainable innovation.</p>

            <p>I currently work as a technology consultant at <a href="https://www.atrevia.com/" class="underlined">
                    Atrevia </a> and as an advisor and curator in different
                projects related to emerging art and NFT. My previous experiences include working as an editor at the
                Web3 magazine <a href="https://www.w3volution.com/" class="underlined">W3volution</a>, as
                an assistant in the department of Ancient
                and Modern painting at the <a href="https://www.museothyssen.org/" class="underlined">Thyssen
                    Bornemisza</a> Collection Foundation, as
                Project Manager & NFT Advisor at <a href="https://photential.art/ " class="underlined">Photential
                    Art</a>, as
                Communications Director of the territorial museum "Campos del Renacimiento" at <a
                    href="https://www.puentia.com/" class="underlined">
                    Puentia</a> and at <span class="underlined"> We Collect</span> as
                Gallery Asistant.

            <p>I have a degree in Journalism and Humanities from <a href="https://www.uc3m.es/Inicio"
                    class="underlined"> Carlos III</a> de Madrid and
                I have different specialization courses in blockchain and contemporary and emerging art. I believe in
                the power of design in technology, helping to create a fluid interaction and an enjoyable
                experience between humans and products, pragmatically solving complex problems with tactical solutions
                and bringing a conceptual idea to reality.</p>
            <p>Get in touch with me! I would love to chat about work, projects, design, art, technology or whatever:)
                oh and of course, May the AI be with you!</p>
